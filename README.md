# Drum Keys&nbsp;&#129345;

A website where you can play your own music using a keyboard.&nbsp;&#9000;. This is one of my first projects&nbsp;&#128304;.

## Description

On the computer: when you press certain keys, it plays back specific sounds (clap, hihat, kick, openhat, boom, ride, snare, tom, tink).

On the phone: you can press the key images to get the appropriate sounds.

## Demonstration
